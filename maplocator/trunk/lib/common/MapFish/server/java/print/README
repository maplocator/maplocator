WHAT?
=====

A command line utility or a servlet used to generate a PDF version of some
layers.


HOW TO BUILD?
=============

To build this project, you need:
  - Maven 2 (http://maven.apache.org/)
  - JRE >= 1.5

The other external libs are taken care of by maven

The build command to use is:
  cd %PROJECT_DIR%/%MAPFISH_DIR%/server/java/print/
  mvn clean install


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

You need to create a YAML configuration file and add some JavaScript code.
Please read this document:
  http://trac.mapfish.org/trac/mapfish/wiki/PrintModuleDoc

From the command line
---------------------
This method can be used to test the layouts.

Example of command (from the directory SVNROOT/server/java/print/print-standalone):
  java -Djava.awt.headless=true -cp target/print-standalone.jar org.mapfish.print.ShellMapPrinter --config=samples/config.yaml --spec=samples/spec.json --output=$HOME/print.pdf

Behind a pylons component
-------------------------

This method should be used only for low traffic web sites. It is quite simple to
put in place, but may be slow due to the starting time of the JRE environment.

To use it within your MapFish project, build the java application and do the
following:

1) Edit the development.ini file and add two lines like that to the [DEFAULT]
   section (change the string "MAPFISH" by something relevant):
     print.jar = %MAPFISHDIR%/server/java/print/print-standalone/target/print-standalone.jar
     print.config = %PROJECT_DIR%/print/config.yaml

2) Edit the MY_PROJECT/config/routing.py file and add those 2 lines (just after
   the "CUSTOM ROUTES HERE"):
     from mapfish.controllers import printer
     printer.addRoutes(map, 'print/', 'printer')

3) Create a MY_PROJECT/controllers/printer.py file with this single line as
   content:
     from mapfish.controllers.printer import PrinterController

4) If you use the MapFish deploy architecture, add this to your "defaults" file,
   at the end of the post_fetch_project function and re-deploy:
     (cd $PROJECT_MAPFISH_DIR/server/java/print/; mvn install || echo "Cannot compile the print module!!!!!!")

5) If you use WSGI, you must add the following line into %PROJECT_DIR%/%PROJECT_NAME%/%PROJECT_NAME%.wsgi (or .wsgi.in)
   before the "loadapp" call :
   # configure the logging system
   from paste.script.util.logging_config import fileConfig
   fileConfig('%PASTE_CONFIG%')


As a tomcat servlet
-------------------

If you already have a tomcat server running or you have performance issues, this
is the way to go.

To install it, deploy the WAR file located in this directory:
  SVNROOT/server/java/print/print-servlet/target

Eventually, edit the web.xml and log4j.properties files. The config.yaml file
is located in the webapp's root directory.
